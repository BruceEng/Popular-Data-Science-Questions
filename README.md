What are the top Data Science tag types and tag usage on a monthly basis over a period of time?

**Stack Exchange** is a network of question-and-answer (Q&A) websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process. The reputation system allows the sites to be self-moderating.

Stack Exchange currently hosts 176 communities that are created and run by experts and enthusiasts who are passionate about a specific topic. They build libraries of high-quality questions and answers, focused on each community's area of expertise. Here are just a few of the communities shown below. The size of 'icon' relates to the magnitude of community usage. **Of all 176 communities, DATA SCIENCE only ranks 46th in terms of usage.**

There's an incredible broad spectrum of subject matters to ask questions about across the 176 communities; covering Technology, Culture/Recreation, Life/Arts, Science, Professional and Business.

Although the title of this guided project is; 'Popular Data Science Questions', the raw data provided does not enable me to identify the most frequent questions. What the raw data provides is Data Science TAG TYPES, not actual questions posed by users.

What I can reveal through data analysis is top Data Science tag types and tag usage on a monthly basis over a period of time and a few other interesting things. 

**At the end of this report**, I will list the current top 10 Data Science questions (across all Tag types) as of May 25 2021 by extracting them from the appropriate data site. I will provide a link to where I obtained the information.
